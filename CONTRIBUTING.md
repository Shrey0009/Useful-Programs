## Contributor's guide

### Where to start?

Before you can begin working on this repository, the first thing\
you need to do, is to clone this repository to your GitHub Profile.\

After you've cloned the repository to your machine, you have a copy of the original one\
on your profile, and if you've cloned it to your GitHub Desktop app, also a local copy on your\
computer.

### Create a new branch

Now that you've cloned this repo, it's time to create a new branch.\
You can do that, by clicking on current branch, and then `new branch`.\

Give the branch a name, fitting for the program you want to submit.\

### Share your code

Now it's time to actually submit your file.\
If you right click on the `current repository` button and press `show in explorer`\
it will open the folder where your code files will go.

If it's more than one file, it would be a good idea to create a folder\
with the same name of your program.

### Commit to the changes

Now that your branch contains the code you want to submit, it's time to\
push those changes to your online GitHub profile.\
(So far the changes have only been local, on your machine)

The upper field is for the name of the commit (and later pull request).\
The field below is for a short description of which changes you made.

### Push the Changes to Github

Click on `Publish branch` to push your changes to your online GitHub repository.\

There will be a green button that says `compare and create pull request`.\
