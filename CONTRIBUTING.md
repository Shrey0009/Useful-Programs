Give the branch a name, fitting for the program you want to submit.\

### Share your code

Now it's time to actually submit your file.\
If you right click on the `current repository` button and press `show in explorer`\
it will open the folder where your code files will go.

If it's more than one file, it would be a good idea to create a folder\
with the same name of your program.

### Commit to the changes

Now that your branch contains the code you want to submit, it's time to\
push those changes to your online GitHub profile.\
(So far the changes have only been local, on your machine)
